# multilocus
Analysis of multi-locus population genetic data.

## Information on this fork

This repository was forked from [agapow/multilocus](https://github.com/agapow/multilocus), since the original author is no longer interested in maintaining MultiLocus. Unfortunately, gcc/g++ has changed to such an extent that the original code no longer compiles. I corrected the non-compilation issue, but I have not yet corrected all of the compilation warnings.
